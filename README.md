# Demo Day 2023

For the MTConnect SC Demo Day in December 2023, this repo contains two projects:

 1. Adapter - An example of how to use TAMS' Model-Awareâ„¢ Adapter SDK to produce MTConnect-compliant Adapters that work seemlessly with the Reference Agent.
 2. Transpiler - An example of how to use the Mtconnect.Transpiler library to automatically generate content directly derived from the MTConnect Standard using the XMI representation of the SysML model.
